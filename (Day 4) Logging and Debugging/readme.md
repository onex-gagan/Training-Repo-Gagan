## Session for Logging and Debugging

**Logging** is the process of recording events, messages, or data generated by a software application during its execution. It helps developers understand the flow of an application, monitor its behavior in production, and detect unusual or unexpected behavior.

**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs or issues in the code. It often involves using breakpoints, step-by-step code execution, and inspecting variables to trace the root cause of a problem.

### Significance:
- **Logging** provides a historical record of events, which is crucial for diagnosing problems, analyzing performance, and auditing activity.
- **Debugging** is essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring correct functionality, and improving the reliability of the software.

Together, logging and debugging are key practices in software development and maintenance.
